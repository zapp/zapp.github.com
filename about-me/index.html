    Hi!
  </h2>

  <p>My name is Sebastian and I'm a 24 year old game design student living in
  Berlin. Get in touch with me:</p>

  <p>Video and board games are a passion of mine - I love to play them
  with friends or enjoy them myself not only on cold winter nights.</p>

  <img src="/img/about-me/hi-small.png" class="mobile only float right" />

  <p>When I started to design little board game prototypes myself and devoured
  the available literature on the topic, I realized that game development
  is in fact different from playing, but something
  just as fullfiling. And that I wanted to do it!</p>

  <p>That was when I decided to delve deeper into game design and found advice
  and company in tutors and fellow students at my university in Berlin. In a small
  group of talented artists and programmers I came to develop a demo for our game
  "Spectaculum - A Traveling Adventure" and wrote my bachelor thesis on <i>Dynamic Feedback Elements in modern Strategy Games</i>. 
  In the following two years I was working for the Ubisoft Studio in Mainz <a href="http://related-designs.com">Related Designs</a>
  as a Junior System Game Designer. 
  </p>

  <p>Currently, I'm back in Berlin starting work in my own start-up game studio I founded with my two friends Robb and Felix recently.
  The company is called <b>trickyard</b> and focuses on iOS mobile games. Get in contact with us whenever you plan to make a mobile
  app via hello@trickyard.com.
  </p> 

  <p>Nice of you dropping by.</p>
