The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of
charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who
would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
