__Might and Magic Heroes Online__ is the first pure online game that
delivers a vast and real Might &amp; Magic Heroes (former "Heroes of Might and Magic")
experience natively in the browser. It is currently under development by [Related Designs][relatedHomepage]
and will be published by [Ubisoft][ubiHomepage] in the coming months. Get am impression
of the game in this early ingame trailer:

As part of their design team I had responsibility over several features in the game, primarily the random artefact creation design
and the loot distribution throughout the game. The game uses a quite complex randomized system when creating and distribution equipment to the players,
may it be via battle rewards or traders.
I also took the chance to write my bachelor thesis on another feature i showed responsible for. It can
be collapsed under the terms "signs &amp; feedback". All elements whose primary purpose is to feedback the palyer on certain actions or give him further details
on demand like tooltips or mouse cursor icons fall into this category.
