Let destiny guide you through uncharted lands, as you'll experience a
world in which bearocratic clerks want to take away the only thing that
maters to youâ€¦ your freedom.

__Spectaculum__ is designed as a couch game for friends and families. Battle
tactics, puzzle solutions and even the control over your caravan require
you to communicate. So listen carefuly and act thoughtfully as you're
heading down a giant canyon with 180 km/h!

of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin.
