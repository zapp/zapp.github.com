__Spectaculum__ is a cooperative action-adventure game for four players.
Slip into the roles of four circus artists- each with their own unique
abilities to fight different kinds of enemies while protecting a caravan
and solving puzzles cooperatively.

Let destiny guide you through uncharted lands, as you'll experience a
world in which bureaucratic clerks want to take away the only thing that
matters to youâ€¦ your freedom.

__Spectaculum__ is designed as a "couch game" for friends and families. Battle
tactics, puzzle solutions and even the control over your caravan require
you to communicate. So listen carefully and act thoughtfully as you're
heading down a giant canyon with 180 km/h!

of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin.
