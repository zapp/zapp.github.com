It has been nearly two years when I set off to Mainz, a city which is not primarily known for being home to one of germanies most talented game dev teams.
But be sure, it should be! I wanted to thank everybody at __Related Designs__ and Ubisoft for being the best colleagues in the world. 
I had a great time there, I learned tons of stuff and got to experience what makes up a great game developer. I will miss you guys!

In the same course I am very happy to be back to my hometown Berlin. And I am even more happy to tell you that I founded my own little game company called __trickyard__.
It is the baby of my friends [Robb][robbHP] and [Felix][felixHP] and me. We make games and interactive software primarily for iOS. Not only will we make our own games, 
but help the world become more playful by offering our work and knowledge to other companies and customers.

It sure will take us a while to settle but when the time has come, you may find further information on the things we do on the companies homepage __ [trickyard.com][trickyardHP] __.
