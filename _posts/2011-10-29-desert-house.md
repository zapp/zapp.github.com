In the course of designing Spectaculum â€“ A Gipsy Adventure i came up with
environmental 3D Assets for the game. They include 2 experimental stone houses
and other adornments like plants, all low poly.

They were created with 3Ds Max 2012 basically achieved through box modeling
using the standard and graphite modelig tools provided, cloth simulation and
other modifiers like noise and path deformation.

For the unwrap I used the peeling mode and the slate material editor for
applying the maps and textures.
