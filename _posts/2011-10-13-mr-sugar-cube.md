Mr. Sugar Cube is based around the idea of making a game with camera vision.

Since it was one of our first IT projects, it didn't get past the early
prototype state, but told us some valuable lessons.

The project was a cooperative work of my friend David Junge and Me and was made
with [Processing][processing].

It is a little rain catcher game and it is upt to you to protect Mr. Sugar Cube
from getting dissolved with a finger controlled umbrella.

You can download the prototype here and  the latest processing version at
[processing.org][processing] along with [the video library][opencv] that is
needed.
