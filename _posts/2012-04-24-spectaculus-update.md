title:      Spectacular Update
---

There has been a lot going on in february this year with "Spectaculum". We were struggling 
hard to finish a demo level of the game as part of our studies and came up with a nice little
[website] I encourage you to visit. Grab your three best friends and head over to play the tutorial
level (and tell them to bring their Xbox Controllers too). You'll also find new screenshots, a new feature
video and a .pdf wrapping up the scenario and gameplay.
Though we liked the outcome of our work it's not quite clear if we will continue working on
our baby in the near future.
