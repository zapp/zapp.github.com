Hello everyone!

This is my very first private post on my very first own homepage and i'd like
to use it to adress my thanks to the people who helped me setting this up.

My good friend [Robb][robb] who did an awesome job coding this website for me and who
also gave great advice regarding layout and usability.
He made it possible to enjoy this site via phones and tablets and in as many
browsers as possible. Thank you Robb!

And my girlfriend Anni who re-read my words and gave her opinion on layout and
documents. Thank you!

This is a personal place as well as a way to share experiences and work with
others. You'll regularly find updates to my projects and other game related news.
If you want to get in touch with me, don't hesitate and check out the "about me"
section.
