Minou is a game concept created around the idea of a gloomy cat adventure. This
work primarily consists of a game concept paper or larger game proposal and was
a more extensive approach to collaborative game design. The document cosists of
descriptions oft he main game idea, the setting, the characters, the story and
layed a solid fundament for the working group.

Although this idea has never been near to real production it helped me to
understand more about presenting, building up and develop ideas. It encouraged
me to go beyond the idea and made me think about functional mechnics and
motivated me to draw artwork.

The team consisted of [Hoa Olliges][hoa], Merlin Bernard, Friedemann MÃ¼cket,
Emauel Arndt and me. The pictures below represent my personal artistic input
although i primarily was responsible for writing.
