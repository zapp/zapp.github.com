NextGene was developed as a little iPhone puzzle game in which the player needs
to construct a double helix with genetic bases flying across the screen.

With completing a given sequence, the player advances through new levels.

We only manged to integrate a time-attack/highscrore mode in the end but made
our first experience in working with Unity 3D. We tried to give the game a
clean, almost sterile look and a futuristic flair.

The project was made by David Junge and me, both doing code and art.

  Unity Player first.
