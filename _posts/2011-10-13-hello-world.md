**Welcome Everybody!**

I'm happy to present my website to you. It took me a while to build
but finally it's here. This is a personal site, it contains
information about myself as well as projects i'm working on right
now or have been in the past.

In the "blog" section (this one) you'll regularly find new
information regarding the progress of one of my projects or I will
tell you about other game related experiences.
The "about me" section covers personal information about myself
and provides contact details and documents.
In "projects" you'll be prompted an overview of my projects
which can also be further reviewed there.
The "games" section holds video and board games for you to play.
And finally in the "extras" category you'll find non-categorizables.

Thanks for dropping in. Enjoy!
