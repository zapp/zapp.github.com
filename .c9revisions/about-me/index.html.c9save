And that I wanted to do it!</p>\n\n  <p>That was when I decided to dive deeper into game design and found advice\n  and company in tutors and fellow students at my university in Berlin. In a small\n  group of talented artists and programmers I came to develop a demo for our game\n  \"Spectaculum - A Traveling Adventure\".</p>\n\n  <p>Currently, I'm in the final phase of my studies, doing an internship at <a href=\"http://related-designs.com\">Related Designs</a>, \n  the makers of the lovely crafted <a href=\"http://anno.de.ubi.com\">Anno-Series</a>, presently busy\n  with creating the recently announced expansion for their latest child \"Anno 2070\". It is called \"Anno 2070: Deep Ocean\" and \n  you can find more about it in the games section of my website.</p> \n\n  <p>Nice of you dropping by.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"five columns alpha omega\">\n  {% for post in site.categories.about-me %}\n    {% include tile.html %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</div>\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2334}]],"length":2334}
